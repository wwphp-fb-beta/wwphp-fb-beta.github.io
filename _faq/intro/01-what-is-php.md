Dear reader, PHP (which stands for recursive backronym of "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor") is a widely-used open source general-purpose
scripting language for writing web applications, dynamically generated pages and command line interface scripts.

PHP is located and best described on the official website [php.net](http://php.net) with updated and in-depth [manual](http://php.net/manual). Reading the manual is highly recommended to get to know PHP in details. As you will pass through the manual pages you will progress with your knowledge.

Use Google search engine for most obvious issues you will find or ask on forums.
