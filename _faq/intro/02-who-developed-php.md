Knowing something about [PHP history](http://php.net/history.php) and who initially created PHP scripting language and
started [PHP](http://php.net) project is an interesting side information that might help inspire you for developing
something yourself as well but might not make you a better PHP developer. You will have to do that on your own ;)

So here it goes... PHP was initially written by **Rasmus Lerdorf**. It all started in 1994 when Rasmus started working on
the very first incarnation of PHP which was a simple set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in the C programming
language.
