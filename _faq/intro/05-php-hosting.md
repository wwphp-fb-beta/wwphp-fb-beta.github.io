In order for a web application to work out of your localhost environment, you usually choose a hosting service provider with a server.

One of the most asked questions is "Are there any good, free providers for decent hosting of your PHP application?".

In short there are, but unfortunately you will meet many issues with that. There is hardly anything completely free available
around you. Same goes to web hosting.

Free hosting limitations:

* traffic quota limit
* server resources quota limit
* php extensions and functionality limitations
* forced injected advertisements

## Types of web hosting services and commonly used termins

### Shared hosting

Shared web hosting service or virtual hosting service is a service where a lot of websites are hosted on the same webserver, and the server's
resources (RAM, disk and processor) are shared among the users. Also, PHP settings and installed extensions are usually the same for all
websites. It might be a good option if you want to get started quickly and painlessly, but still leave the maintaining and server upgrading
to your preffered hosting service.

### VPS

VPS or virtual private server is a next step in hosting service. It can be a bit more pricey than shared hosting, but no other user shares your package.
VPSes can get a dedicated amount of RAM, disk and processor speed so your application is already a step to gain more freedom in settings and
customizations.

### Dedicated server

Dedicated server means an entire server machine is available for you. More resources and more disk quota is available that way. The price can be high, but flexibility and customization are at its best. Choose this option if you're an advanced user with some kind of system administration knowledge.

### Collocation

Collocated hosting means that you bring your own hardware to your data center service provider, and they plug it onto their high speed and availability network.

### Cloud hosting

This is latest trend in web hosting services.

Do yourself and your application's audience a favour and invest a bit into your hosting infrastructure. Stability and aviability of
your application will depend on that big time.
