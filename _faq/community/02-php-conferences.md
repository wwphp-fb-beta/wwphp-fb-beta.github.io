PHP conferences are PHP specific events at which established well known PHP speakers present their
topics and users meet and discuss PHP related topics and have fun. They occur all over the world in many countries.

[PHP.net](http://php.net) always updates and announces PHP conferences from all over the world. You can check the list of current conferences happening in the [PHP's conference section](http://php.net/conferences/index.php).
