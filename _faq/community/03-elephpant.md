ElePHPant is that adorable PHP mascot with an elephant in its design.

The ElePHPant logo was originally introduced and created in 1998 for the PHP community by Vincent Pontier - spiritual father of
thousands ElePHPants around the world. In 1998, there were mostly CGI scripts used for dynamic websites. A friend, François BUFFIÈRE,
introduced Vincent to the PHP language, which would according to him revolutionize the interactions with visitors on different websites. Vincent came up with the ElePHPant by
drawing PHP letters on a paper and playing with them a little. He was noticing they appeared to look like the shape of an elephant.

In France at that time only few sites were talking about PHP. One was Jean-Pierre Dezelus' page and he was also a collector of elephants.
He asked Vincent to make an elephant logo for PHP with same style as the original PHP logo - a blue oval with a black outline gradient.

Then the original ElePHPant logo came to birth:

The plush animal toy - ElePHPant came to be 10 years after that.

ElePHPants are now present at many PHP conferences and programmers computers for inspiration and fun. Many PHP projects have also made variations
of the ElePHPant with their logo on it.
