REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It was claimed by [Roy Fielding](https://twitter.com/fielding) in his doctor disertation in 2000.

## What is the difference between REST and RESTful?

Term RESTful refers to web services implementing such a REST architecture.

## Resources

PHP libraries and resources to checkout.

* [Hateoas](https://github.com/willdurand/Hateoas) - PHP library to support implementing representations for HATEOAS REST web services.
* [Bullet PHP](http://bulletphp.com/) - A micro framework for building REST APIs.
* [Restler](https://github.com/Luracast/Restler) - A lightweight framework to expose PHP methods as RESTful web API.

## Technical critique

* [RESTful APIs, the big lie](http://mmikowski.github.io/the_lie/) - Issues about REST and how JSON-Pure APIs could do better, with a [follow up article](http://mmikowski.github.io/json-pure/).
