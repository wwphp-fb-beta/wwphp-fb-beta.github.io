To run the PHP code the best thing is to run it through a web server such as Apache or Nginx on your server. For testing, sharing and quick reviewing
the code there are PHP online code editors which can execute your code in a browser:

* [Runnable](https://runnable.io/)
* [PHPTester](http://phptester.net)
* [SandboxOnlinePhpFunctions](http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com)
