CMS (content management system) is an application and unlike a framework it provides you more higher level developed architecture for working
with content - publishing, editing, organizing and deleting. Simple difference between framework and CMS is that CMS is built with framework.
There are many open source CMSes built with PHP that might be worth picking for your project since they speed up the project delivery and they
have large communities behind them which can help you a lot.

Which CMS should be right for the project is quite honestly impossible to answer in general. You must know the benefits and limitations of them before
creating a project. We are trying to avoid "flamewar" about CMSes so we won't list all PHP CMSes here. PHP community has largest number of open source
CMS system available compared to other web programming languages.
