Building your own framework can be useful for the following reasons:

* You can learn a lot - advanced design patterns, concepts and software architecture
* You know exactly what certain parts of your code does without learning from the documentation of others

However on the PHP market there are a lot of really quality open source frameworks that many projects and organizations use to build software better and faster. Picking established open source framework has its benefits:

* When working in a team, people that already know certain open source framework can faster join the project
* Better quality and a lot of identified and fixed bugs than your custom framework that hasn't been tested in a lot of projects yet

## What knowledge you will need to create a decent framework?

For creating a framework you will have to know OOP, design patterns, ORM, authentication, MVC (model view controller) and other advanced concepts.
