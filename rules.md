<div class="ui grey ribbon spaced label">Preamble</div>

This Document defines the Code of Conduct (from now on called: CoC) of the
international PHP Facebook Group (from now on called: the group) and its environments.
You **accept** the given rules of this CoC **when joining** our group **or participating** on our repositories.
You **must** follow this CoC, **any violation** results in the temporary or permanent removal of your membership(s).
This CoC counts for everyone, administrators and regular members. The content of this CoC is not open for discussion.

The following rules are **mandatory** to participate at the group and all repositories:

<div class="ui black ribbon spaced label" id="act-social">Content localization</div>

Anything published at the timeline of the group must be in **English**. The members of the group are located all over
the world. The language of the group has been standardized to **English** to guarantee painless communication. Attached
shares localized into other languages will be removed from the timeline without further notice. Posted content that is
localized into other languages and that does not count as a regular facebook share will be removed from the timeline and
the topic author will be temporary removed from the group.

Commits done to our repositories must be localized in **English**. Commits that are not localized in English will be rejected.
Issues must be localized in **English**. Issues that are not localized in English will be closed without any investigation.

<div class="ui black ribbon spaced label" id="act-social">Content quality</div>

Shares and posts to the timeline **must have an regular level of quality**. Questions **must be researched** before posting them.
The group acts as a group to help on specific problems, not to read out documentations or querying the web for you. You
have to **avoid large code snippets** at the timeline of the group. We recommend to serve source code in any case as a
[Gist](https://gist.github.com) to grant the best possible readability. Large source codes posted to the timeline are
hard to read, because of the limited space on facebook. Topics with large source codes as its content will be removed from
the timeline of the group. Comments with large source codes as its content will be removed from the content stream. Repeated
post of large source codes are punished with a permanent removal of the membership(s).

Commits done to our repositories must be fully researched and localized into English. There is no place for low quality content.

<div class="ui black ribbon spaced label" id="act-social">Forbidden content</div>

It is not allowed to post content that does not cover web-centric development. Any violation of this rule will result in
the permanent removal of the membership. Content that does violate the facebook community rules will be forwarded to the
facebook staff. Topics that announces **job offers** must be posted into the announced topics and explicitly **not to the timeline of the group**.

Committing any kind of the described forbidden content to our repository will be rejected and your behavior will be alerted to the github staff.

<div class="ui black ribbon spaced label" id="act-social">Social behavior</div>

**You have to act social**. There is no space for harassments, bulling or political content that does not cover web development topics.
You should never compromise or damage others at the group. Violating this rule will result in a permanent removal of the membership(s).
